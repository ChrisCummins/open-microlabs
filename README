Open MicroLabs is free and open source software for logging analogue signals
to a computer by using a microcontroller and a serial connection. It began
development as part of an assignment for Undergraduate studies at Aston
University, UK.

INSTALL DIRECTIONS
==================
Before running the program, the RXTX library binaries must be placed in the
required locations:

Windows
	Copy the following files from the appropriate arch directory in lib
	(lib\win_x86 or lib\win_x64). Under most circumstances, the
	JAVA_HOME path is located under C:\Program Files\Java\

	RXTXcomm.jar -> <JAVA_HOME>\jre\lib\ext
	rxtxSerial.dll -> <JAVA_HOME>\jre\bin
	rxtxParallel.dll -> <JAVA_HOME>\jre\bin

Linux
	Copy the following files from the appropriate arch directory in lib
	(lib/linux_x64).

	RXTXcomm.jar -> <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/ext
	librxtxSerial.so -> <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/i386/
	librxtxParallel.so -> <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/i386/
	
	Under most circumstances, this can be performed by opening a terminal
	emulator and navigating to the lib directory and performing these
	three commands:
	
	sudo cp RXTXcomm.jar $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext/
	sudo cp librxtxSerial.so $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/i386/
	sudo cp librxtxParallel.so $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/i386/
